Project Summary

To start off, I started with BeautifulSoup, which I found much easier to work with of the 2 options. Getting the data from the website was "souper" easy thanks to the pretty simple process it takes. However, I ran into some issues when it came to many rows having rowspans. So I had to write a for loop to deal with each individual row and cell. I did this for each of the tables that were scraped by BeautifulSoup. Now for the AI scraper, I didn't end up getting it to work as it wouldnt scrape the data in a format that was transferrable into a dataframe. For the prompts I tried to be as specific as possible with what I wanted but eventually the keys that I needed just stopped working and I couldn't find a way to get it to work again so I just had to leave it there unfortunately. I used Jupyter Notebook as I prefer using it when working with python and then transferred my code over to VSCode when it was complete and working. Overall, the difficulties I had with this assignment we're mostly formatting problems that I was able to work out for some problems, but not for all.
